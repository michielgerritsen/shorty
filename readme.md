# Shorty

## Local commands

Shorty is created to make it easy to create shortcuts to commands. Just run for example:

`shorty add symfony bin/console`

Now you have the `symfony` command available globally. When you switch to another folder, the symfony command will still work and be executed in the folder where you added the Shorty command.

## Global commands

You can also add global commands. Shorty will search for this command in all underlying folders. So for example, when running:

`shorty global symfony bin/console`

You can then execute the `symfony` command in any folder within your Symfony project. So when you are in `config/packages/dev` for example, you can run:

`symfony server:run`

And the server will be started. This will work for any Symfony project.

## How to add Laravel's Artisan?

When installing Laravel on the recommended way, the `artisan` file is not executable. This prevents Shorty from running it in the default way. That's why you need to provide it with the interpreter is needs. You can add the `artisan` command to Shorty like this:

`shorty global artisan artisan --interpreter=$(which php)`

## Installation

Shorty is meant to be installed global using Composer:

`composer global require michielgerritsen/shorty`

## The fix command

Sometimes you mess up your global Composer folder and the commands won't work anymore. You can use the `fix` command to remove and reinstall all commands.

```
shorty fix
```
