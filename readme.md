# Shorty

Shorty is created to make it easy to create shortcuts to commands. Just run for example:

`shorty add m2 bin/magento`

Now you have the `m2` command available globally. When you switch to another folder, the m2 command will still work and be executed in the folder where you added the Shorty command.
